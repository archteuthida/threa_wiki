2nd Era: the reason the gods fled Threa is because a being was unleashed: the Godeater, that can eat/destroy gods. This most fled the physical realm of Threa, though some stayed in the vicinity (such as Melete as a new moon) so that they could continue to provide boons to their followers. Others give support from the Endless Citidal or their own private planes, though their influence is more limited from such a distance. 

The Godeater is a creation / manifestation of Moros, and thus an agent of chaos and destruction.  It can summon demons and other chaotic creatures upon its appearance. However, it is mostly dormant when not in the presence of gods, and remains on Threa, not traveling to other planes (even the Underworld)

The Godeater is eventually sealed away by arcane mages in between the Eras. However, popular opinion and history conflates the arrival of the Godeater and arcane mages and they end up blamed for its arrival due to their heretical practices, as well as the gods fleeing Threa in the later age. In truth, the gods simply did not trust the shackles imposed on the Godeater and fled for their own safety. 

There would be a rise in the second Era of mortal ascendants: Hallowed who grew powerful enough to essentially serve as gods. These rose to rule across many kingdoms and civilizations in this dark age. 

When the Azanite empire appears their goals are to permanently destroy the Godeater so that Azan can manifest on Threa and rule. This goes in hand with their goal (and apparent success) at repairing Pale rifts and rejoining separate lands.

Hallowed: all mortals have the ability to absorb Shards (fragments of Exalted Volition), but for most it is limited. Those few that can absorb much and rapidly grow in power are known as Hallowed. Anyone can become Hallowed-it is usually triggered by a specific event, trauma, magical or divine influence, etc. and can happen any time in a mortal's life. In extremely rare circumstances someone can be born Hallowed, usually identified by an unusual birthmark or other sign. 

The gods are quick to claim Hallowed as the result of divine favor alone, though anyone that studies accounts of Hallowed can see that their extraordinary power arises regardless of their faith.

Progenitor ancestors: Eldorim?

They arose on Threa before it broke, and sought to conquer existence, toppling the Pillars and taking power for themselves. 

Aedai turned Issinia against them, and their great empire crumbled. Threa shattered into the Broken Lands, and monsters boiled up from the spaces between. Eldorim ruins were buried in the earth, only to re-emerge at random in future ages. 

Issinia, resenting this genocide, destroyed Aedai in turn, turning the Endless Citadel to ruins, and making the Lost Roads a perilous maze. 

The stranded ghosts of the Eldorim were used to form the current folk by Ameti. The power of the Eldorim can spontaneously flare in mortals, making them Hallowed, beings of quickly growing power and ability. 

The Eldorim amassed great power, technology, and magic. Many of their techniques are lost to time, thoguh their ruins still stand. They bowed to no one, and sought to topple even the Pillars, and tule over all. Eldorim temples are founded not to gods, but to those at the pinnacle of achievement in their society, who were themselves extremely powerful beings. 

[[Karzantiss]] was the great capital of the Eldorim, so impressive that it stands even to the modern day. It is said there are more secrets buried beneath the city than can be uncovered in a hundred lifetimes. 

[[Goblinkin]] were created by the Eldorim, their attempt to act as gods and shape their own life. The results were not to their satisfaction, but were deemed suitable as laborers and soldiers. This lasted until a major slave revolt caused the Eldorim to deem them unworthy of further pursuit. Goblinkin were then forced to flee to the outskirts of civilization, and were otherwise uinted down by Eldorim. The Eldorim sought to create more suitable subordinates, but the work was not completed before their downfall. Goblinkin would later be taken under the wing of a trickster god, then a sorcerer king. In the current ages most have lost their taste for gods and rulers of any stripe.
