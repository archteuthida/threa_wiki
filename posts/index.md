# Worldbuilding Goals for the Threa Setting

The goal is to create a setting that can accommodate various themes, tropes, and styles. Some general design ideas for the setting are:

#### Game Systems
Ideally, it would be nice to be able to use many different game systems in the setting (at least within the mostly fantasy realm). Thus the setting can accommodate different styles of play from super-powered heroes to lowly adventurers likely to die, political intrigue and kingdom building and warfare.

There is a lore reason then to explain the discrepancy between super-powered heroes in games such as D&D, Pathfinder, and Icon, and those from other systems like Into the Odd, Cairn, Knave, Mork Borg, Swords and the Serpentine, etc. That is, there are certain individuals who by fate, accident, or design are capable of more than typical mortals. 

These are the [[Hallowed]], and they can absorb shards from [[Aedai Speaks the Primordial Word]], the shattered creator of the universe, allowing them vast capabilities. Hallowed are rare enough to be notable, but not so rare as that anyone would be surprised to see one. Unsurprisingly, Hallowed tend to rise in society to become rulers, commanders, and leaders of religious orders, though many turn to adventuring or are explicitly tasked with heroic quests.

#### Timeline
The setting covers several broad Ages within which are different Eras. each Era fulfills a different theme or trope (which might also vary by region). A transition between Eras is punctuated with [[Portentous Events]], major, world-changing circumstances that can’t be altered through play. However, the events within an Era should be only broadly defined at most, so as to leave room for history to be developed by game sessions. 

**Age of Stars**: See [[Origin of the World]] and the [[Unbroken Era]]. This covers the history of the mysterious progenitor people, the [[Eldorim]]. Typically not playable as is before the creation of mortals.

**Age of Flame**: Covers the bulk of history. 

* [[1st Era]]: Bronze age and mythic tropes. Gods walk the land and heroes attempt to gain glory for their favor.  Themes and influences: Bronze age, ancient world myths, sword & sandals, The Odyssey, 
* [[2nd Era]]: A dark age following a catastrophic event. The gods of before are weakened or destroyed, leaving mortal [[Ascendant]]s to step up and fill the gap. Empires and civilizations collapse into small city-states and villages, with deadly monsters roaming the wilds between. Themes and influences: Dark ages, early medieval, the Witcher, The Last Kingdom
* [[3rd Era]]: A period of growth and growing stability. Mages work under the watchful eye of an order to cleanse the land, and a powerful new god rises with promises of safety and unity. Themes and influences: Late medieval to renaissance era, spreading religious order, rise of magical power
* [[4th Era]]: A magitocracy forms as mages overthrow their bonds and form their own rule. Elsewhere an invasion of an oppressive Elven empire darkens the land and conquers much of the continent. People learn how to hunt in the dangerous places between lands for creatures that can fuel powerful magitech. Themes and influences: 18th century, magitech, Dishonored, Eberron

**Age of Darkness**: A post-apocalyptic time stemming from the hubris of mortals. Intense magical storms scour the land, with only tenuous islands of living beings managing to scrape by. A desperate few seek to find ways to heal the damage.

#### Cultures and Language
Create culturally distinct regions, including languages. Common is a shorthand / pidgin that anyone can use for basic communication (usually trade) but in depth nuance requires knowing a regional language. Different ancestries within a region may have their own regional forms of their ancestral language (eg, [[Pelepelonian Isles|Pelepelonian]] Elvish may be different from Elvish in other regions). Someone from a region is likely to have at least passing knowledge of neighboring region languages, and of other ancestral languages in the same region.

Unique origins for several ancestries. See [[Goblinkin]], [[Orcs]], [[Dragons and Dragonkin]]. 

Culture among an ancestry is not homogenous, it differs by region as well as other factors. eg. mountain Dwarves have a very different society than surface Dwarves that live among other folk, though there may be some similarities. 

Travel is rare among most folk particularly in any Era before the 4th. Although a region will have similar overall culture, each city and village will have its own quirks, and even the town over the hill would be considered “far away” by most common folk. Most people are born, grow up, and die within the same village, or at most one away. There are certain times when empires grow and connect a region or multiple regions, allowing for easier mobility between areas (or the taking of captives from conquered lands), in this case it is more likely to see travelers and settlers from more varied regions. Truly large cities are fairly rare until later history, but those that exist are hubs for mingling of cultures and folk, particularly the great city of [[Karzantiss]]. 

#### Currency and Economy
Silver standard (all GP prices are silver), with 100 silver = 1 Gold piece. [[Shards]] are magical material that can be found and used as currency or to gain strength. 1 shard = 1 silver = 1 XP (for games with increasing XP / level) or 1 XP / Level (for games with flat XP per level like PF2E).
