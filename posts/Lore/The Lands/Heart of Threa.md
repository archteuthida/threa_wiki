The Heart of [[Threa]] describes the continent that makes up what could be considered the central formation of all the material plane. It is where the [[Thrae]] gods’ power is strongest, and where the [[Atreans|Atrean]] gods came to hold their rule. Powerful ancient magic and artifacts can be found in this region from [[Threa]]’s earliest days. This, along with the belief that those who hold the Heart are destined to control all the realms, makes this continent the most sought after territory for gods and mortal invaders alike.
