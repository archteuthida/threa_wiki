A mighty city built by the [[Eldorim]] as their capital on [[Threa]] (though most of the actual building was at [[Goblinkin]] hands). These enduring ruins last through each Era, one of the foremost relics of [[Eldorim]] civilization, and certainly the most visible and accessible. The labyrinthine streets and underground are so vast that a multitude of secrets going back to the time of its founding are hidden in its layers and forgotten corners.
