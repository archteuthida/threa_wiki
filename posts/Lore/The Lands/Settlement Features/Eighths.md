Eighths are the colloquial name for [[Ametian Folk#Halflings|Halfling]] quarters within other mortal settlements (though many have end up having Eighth has the formal name). They first started to appear in the [[2nd Era]] after the [[Fall of the Divine Tower]], when travel and the wilds became increasingly dangerous. Though many Halfling nomads carried on their old traditions despite the dangers, another contingent “settled” into such communities. 

However, saying they settled is used loosely, as families of Haflings living in an Eighth continue to move between settlements with other Eighths on a regular basis, anywhere from every few months to every few years.

Eighths are vibrant communities featuring Halfling culture, which is always varied and exciting given the frequent exchange of goods, ideas, and news. Though everything in an Eighth is typically scaled to Halfling size, many other folk find time to visit an Eighth if seeking news from abroad or oddities that may not be found in other markets.
