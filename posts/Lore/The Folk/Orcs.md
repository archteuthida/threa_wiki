**Origin**
Orcs were formed after the arrival of the [[Atreans|Atrean]] gods in the 1st Era, during the war between the [[Atreans]] and the [[Thrae]]. Formed from fanatical elven clans, who bargained with an occult god, [[Iasu]], and who traded their long-lives and grace for proficiency in strength and combat. 

While orcs are stereotyped as green brutes, they actually come in various hues such as amethyst, crimson, and golden hued, and while some are broad and strong, others are lithe and nimble like their elf ancestors. They have inherited the cultural richness of their elven former selves, though it tends to get pushed aside for matters of battle against their hated foes. However one thing does tend to be true of Orcish nature: they have short fuses and a simmering rage ready to boil over at any time. This is a characteristic—many say a curse—bestowed by [[Iasu]].

The Verdant Charge are those most resembling the stereotype of a hulking green brute, though they are of course more complex than how they are depicted by outsiders. They favor strength, brute force, and head on attacks—they are not ones for subtlety or negotiation. They are fearsomely strong, and unrelenting warriors. This is the largest and most prolific clan.

The Amethyst Blade are lithe and most closely resemble their elvish ancestors of all the orc clans. They are swift strikers, attacking from ambush to deal devastating blows, then fading back into the wilderness. They have skin of an purple hues and more subtle tusks.

The Crimson Hand are a tribe that emphasizes magic, particularly primal magic. They wield this with devastating effect, turning the very land itself against their foes. Their skin is deep red hues. 

The Golden Chain are a clan that focus on mounted combat, often utilizing more extoic mounts. In later ages, they come to regret their transformation and collectively seek a way to revert back to Elves. They are the most likely to be found living in settlements of other races. Their skin is a burnished golden hue.

After the [[Thrae]] and [[Atreans]] fighting came to a stalemate and settled into relative peace, many Orcish clans did not know what to do but carry on fighting. They became raiders and defenders of the wilds at the fringes of civilization. Others, seeing the truce as defeat, disappeared into deep wild lands or left for other planes in disgust.

**2nd Era**
The [[Fall of the Divine Tower]] saw a sort of pyrrhic victory for the [[Thrae]], as [[Atreans|Atrean]] Gods fled the plane in fear of [[Morosh the Blasphemous Excrescence]]. However, it is a bitter relevation, as Morosh threatened [[Thrae]] gods as much as any others, and they cannot leave [[Threa]]. Orcs fought with all others to contain the threat.

Once the greatest threat was contained, Orcish clans saw the new situation as a chance to push back against [[Atreans|Atrean]] civilization, and reclaim territory for the [[Thrae]]. Orcish attacks in this vein contributed heavily to the fracturing of the [[Atrean Empire]], and withdrawal of [[Atreans]] folk to huddled defensive city states.

However, between the weakened [[Thrae]] gods, and the increase in deadly monsters roaming the wilds that attacked indiscriminately, even skilled Orc warrior clans faced hardship and struggled to survive. 

**3rd Era**
With many factions regaining strength and stabilization through the use of magic or other means, [[Atreans]] folk once again began to spread and settle wild parts of [[Threa]]. By this time those Orc clans that survived were divided, some continued to hold old grudges. Others were so distanced from the motivations of their forbearers they wondered why they continued to fight for this cause, especially as they felt little support from [[Thrae]] gods anymore. Some clans simply turned to mercenary work, becoming a surprising but increasingly more common sight among [[Atreans]] communities.

**4th Era**
The Imperial elves of [[Irithiel]] of course scorned Orcs, all the more since in ancient times they were once elven. They considered it an affront they would throw away their elven nature for their cause, all the worse since it was apparently fruitless. 

However Orcish proficiency in battle couldn’t be ignored, and most clans were still familiar with the wild places at the edges of the empire. Some clans even helped fleeing [[Atreans]] refugees escape the thumb of the growing new empire.
