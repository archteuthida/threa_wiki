When [[Threa]] was shattered in the [[Shardfall]], many folk fled to the [[Echo Realm]], including some [[Fey]] and Elves of the early world. The Elves that came to live in this shadowy plane were changed, some growing more like the shadow nature of the plane and others reacting in an opposite manner, becoming vibrant and inquisitive. These latter were the gnomes. Though diminished in stature from their elven ancestors, they make up for it with dazzling presence and energy. They also acquired a curious traitâ€”as long as they seek out new experiences, they can prolong their lifespan. If they stop, they begin to bleach and fade, and risk death.

This has driven many gnomes out into the lands to explore and continue to find new experiences.
