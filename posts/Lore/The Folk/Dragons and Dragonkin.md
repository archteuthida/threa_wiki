The first dragons, the Great Wyrms, are said to have been born from scales of the Godwyrm shaken free at the beginning of time. An ancient race with much knowledge of [[Truespeech]], the language of magic and power, dragons are proud and intelligent creatures. 

Most dragons settled on [[Threa]] shortly after it formed, finding it a comfortable and quiet home, though some can be found throughout the other realms. They would later be competing for the land with the [[Fey]] and particularly [[Giantkin]]. Though dragons are immensely powerful they are typically solitary and could never form long-lasting alliances to compete with the organization of the giants. 

Dragons are powerfully attuned with the arcane, and their speech is derived from [[Truespeech]], which in turn is drawn from the [[Litany of Creation]]. It would later become the basis for those who would study arcane magic, and in the earliest eras, were the only source of learning for arcane mages. However, dragons horde their knowledge and power as closely as any gemstone or other treasure, so finding a dragon willing to teach magic is a rare and dangerous task.

Chromatic and other dragons formed from natural elements are the first dragons. The oldest and most powerful consider themselves peers with the gods. Some would come to find a purpose in worship, either with gods or [[Eldorim]], and their scales would change to metallic hues. Their magic would become augmented with divine blessings.

Imperial dragons are a draconic offshoot, different in appearance and ability to their winged cousins. Their attitude toward gods goes beyond mere dismissal of the gods toward active hostility. They wish to overthrow and supplant any gods in regions they settle in. In particular they have done so in [[Irithiel]], the core of the Imperial Elven empire. Here they are revered, and are the ones who are considered to divinely choose the Elven emperor, and spur on the Imperial Elves to conquer other lands.

Dragons of all kinds are almost always solitary and territorial, especially with their own kind. Even the kindest dragons or those who insinuate themselves into communities of other folk draw a hard boundary against other dragons. The one time dragons are brought together is for a Dragonsmoot to challenge each other on a hierarchy of power and mate. This does not occur on regular intervals, but it tends to be dozens of years if not centuries between Dragonsmoots, making it a rare and wonderous spectacle. Of course, few non-dragons have ever witnessed such an event, both due to the incredibly dangerous nature of approaching so many dragons, and the secluded locations they tend to take place in so as to avoid any outside interference. Once the moot begins dragons challenge each other to various contests of strength, intellect, magic, and even performance to rank themselves according to a complex ranking that is truly only understood to other dragons, though typically the eldest and most powerful dragons tend to rise to the top. Then, dragons may mate according to these rankings. Because this event is rare, dragons reproduce at an incredibly slow pace compared to other beings.

### Dragonborn
Dragons developed a special ritual to create a race of servitors in their image. This was largely in response to dragon’s slow rate or reproduction, especially in the face of other folk. Thus was created the Dragonborn, humanoid beings with draconic features, and sometimes draconic abilities. 

Dragonborn serve their dragon until death, but may be sent out on independent long term missions in order to achieve some goal of their master, and are often given some latitude in doing so. Dragonborn that outlive their master wander the plane much like ronin. 

The ritual to create Dragonborn is jealously guarded by all dragons, with younger dragons having to learn the ritual either by giving up some significant treasure or knowledge to an elder, stealing the ritual, or by working it out on their own. Dragonborn formed from their creator dragon take on the characteristics of that dragon, including scale color and energy of their breath weapon.

One sect of Dragonborn were pitied by their master for not being able to reproduce, and were given the ritual upon his death. They keep this and their sect secret so that they are not destroyed by other dragons seeking keep the secret out of Dragonborn hands. 

### Kobolds
One group of Dragonborn attempted to steal the ritual and cast it. However the ritual rites they managed to acquire were incomplete. The result were the kobolds, smaller dragonkin. To everyone's surprise, it was found they could reproduce normally, without requiring a ritual, and were able to do so in great numbers. Kobolds are generally looked down upon by other dragon kin, but many still seek service of dragons or Dragonborn. Their cleverness and presumed expendability make them useful, if disdained, tools to dragons.

However, since they are free to form their own communities, kobolds can be found all across the world in their own settlements, or even amongst those of other folk. 

### Half-Dragons
Dragons enamored by mortals can use a version of this ritual to mate with them, usually involving polymorphing into that mortal’s race. The result is half dragons, who themselves cannot reproduce. However, they gain powerful abilities from their draconic parentage. Many attempt to become great champions (or infamous villains), taking any action they can to secure their name and legacy.
