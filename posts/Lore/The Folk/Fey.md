The Fey covers a broad category of beings first created by the [[Thrae]] gods from materia of the land and spirits that arose from life. Due to this nature, a Fey that is killed cannot go on to an afterlife or be resurrected. However, they are immortal unless killed by intention or accident. Fey take many forms, but tend to be alien in thought from mortals, and range in attitude toward mortals from tricksters to dangerous supernatural beings.



### Fey Folk
Though most Fey were created by the [[Thrae]] gods and lack souls, some folk that live amongst the Fey or are influenced by them are soul-bearing beings. This is often other folk transformed by Fey magic or the influence of other planes. Many hail from the [[Echo Realm]], where many Fey fled after [[Shardfall]]. Examples of such folk are changelings, fetchlings, and some pixies and sprites. [[Gnomes]] could also fall under this category, as well as some clans of elves.
