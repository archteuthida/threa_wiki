#### Elves
**Origin**
Elves are the first mortal race formed by [[Ameti]], long-lived thanks to the amount of her life energy she poured into their creation to stave off her firstborn, [[Death]]. Formed from heartwood of the ancient forests of [[En’Taia]], they first Elves were creatures of nature and the wilds, and found close kinship with the Fey. In the [[Unbroken Era]], they also founded the first [[Treeholds]], fortresses and villages woven amongst mighty trees.

Elves long lives make them seem distant and slow to change to other folk. Shorter lived people often find it hard to relate to elves, and elves in turn tend to protect themselves from the sadness of losing short lived friends and loves. Still Elves may be found on adventures to expand their experiences, particularly among those in their first century.

**1st Era**
After the fall of [[Exalted Volition]] and the shattering of the lands, the main homeland of the Elves, [[Irithiel]], was cut off from the heart of [[Threa]]. Others left for the [[Echo Realm]], many becoming scions of the [[House Below]]. Those few who remained in [[Threa]] were the most resolute defenders of the primal world and [[Thrae]] beliefs, typically defending their forests ruthlessly against incursions from the [[Atreans|Atreans]].

**2nd Era**
Elves from [[Irithiel]] formed a magic fueled empire in their homeland, overthrowing their patron deity in favor of an Elven [[Ascendant]] hierarchy bound by a complex system of magical geases and obligation. They would begin finding ways to raid other realms through magical portals in a practice known as the Wild Hunt. [[Irithiel]] Elves in particular generally harbor a belief of Elven superiority and subjugation of other folk. With the exodus of gods from [[Threa]] following the arrival of [[Morosh the Blasphemous Excrescence]], the raids of the Wild Hunt go more unchallenged, and the [[Irithiel]] Elves begin to scout for a potential invasion of [[Threa]].

The [[Thrae]] Elves who remained continue as staunch but dwindling defenders of their wild lands. The exodus of the gods has made the wild places dangerous and filled with monsters, so even where Atreans are not intruding on their lands such elves have found themselves in dire straights.

Other elves have decided to integrate into general society, seeking the safety of populated areas in exchange for their artistry and knowledge. 

**3rd Era**
Due to many Elves’ knack for magic, many are part of the [[Covenant of the Silver Dawn]] as “officially” sanctioned arcane mages. Others are secluded heretic mages in remote towers and villages. They often found themselves at odds with the Azanite empire, which sought to condemn arcane magic. 

**4th Era**
The major Elven factor of the 4th Era is the arrival of invaders from [[Irithiel]], who sought to establish an empire in [[Threa]]. They were largely successful, founding the [[Irithiel]] Elven Imperium across much of settled lands. This empire favored arcane magic and magitech, and therefore largely put to rest old prejudices and worship condemning arcane magic. Arcane study and research flourished, even as divine worship was largely driven underground with religious practices heavily controlled by the empire.

Elves who were native to [[Threa]] or other lands found themselves in a precarious position. On one hand, they were outsiders to the [[Irithiel]] empire and treated accordingly, even if their general station prospered on account of the dominate ancestry. On the other they were loathed by other mortal folk by association with the domineering and often brutal [[Irithiel|Irithielians]], even having nothing to do with their cousins’ empire. 


#### Dwarves
**Origin**
After the Elves, [[Ameti]] shaped living stone around more souls, forming the Dwarves. More judicious now with her life power, the dwarves had a shorter, though still long lifespan. Some dug deep into the mountains to make their homes, while others helped their Elven kindred building the beautiful and intricated [[Treeholds]], particularly during the [[Unbroken Era]]. 

Dwarves are seen as reliable but often stubborn and inflexible. They also tend to form tight-knit family clans that often have a reputation of feuding with other families. However, all such feuds are set aside when dealing with an outside threat. Nothing brings a dwarf hold together faster than the suspicion of outsiders. 

This culture is found to a lesser degree with dwarves who chose to live among other mortals. There they tend to be a communities master builders and crafters. While they still have a close and clannish community in such settlements, they are far more willing to deal with and befriend other mortal folk.

The dwarves who make their home deep in the hearts of mountains come into natural conflict with giant kin, who also call the mountains and deep places home. Thus the dwarves and giants are enemies more often than not. Since giantkin are typically [[Thrae]] by tradition and history, dwarves are typically [[Atreans]] out of spite if nothing else.

**1st Era**
Dwarves of the 1st Era quickly accepted the gifts and promises of the [[Atreans|Atrean]] gods, if only to claim an advantage over their enemies the giants. Favoring gods of craft and family, they offer the riches found deep underground as offerings. Dwarven kingdoms in this Era are more open to travelers and allies, and serve as an important foothold in the efforts of [[Atreans|Atrean]] gods against the [[Thrae]]. 

**2nd Era**
With the exodus of the gods and the reduction of their boons, mountain dwarves holed up in their mountain strongholds for security, often becoming paranoid and hostile to outsiders. 

The ‘lowland’ dwarves living in other settlements continued as they were, offering key expertise in forming defensive walls and other fortifications against an increasingly dangerous world. However, they were cut off as much as anyone else from their mountain dwelling kin, to the point they were considered on par with any other non-dwarven folk. Many such dwarves were quick to join the Azanite cause as they expanded and conquered the lands, seeking the stability the Azanite empire brought.

**3rd Era**
Dwarves were instrumental in crafting the [[Covenant of the Silver Dawn]] holds that held mages secure, protecting them from the outside world and vice versa. Many are members of the Silver Dawn themselves.

**4th Era**
With the arrival of the [[Irithiel]] Elven empire, dwarves, like all other non-elves, were relegated to second class citizens at best. However, their talents for crafting did not go unrecognized, and many could make a decent living supporting the burgeoning Elven empire.

Mountain dwarves are at odd with the Elves, who sought to access the sources of treasure and deep magic they hold deep in their holdfasts. 

#### Halflings
**Origin**
[[Ameti]] formed Halflings from dirt and water around souls. She gave less of her life to these, feeling the limits of her mortality. They were flighty and wandering due to their nature, and traveled in nomadic groups all across the land.

Halflings are often seen as flighty and carefree, but are reliable and loyal companions if their friendship is earned. Most travel in large nomadic groups by land or on riverboats, but in later eras a few groups have settled, typically in their own quarters of larger settlements of other folk. They get along well with humans, who have a similar lifespan and relatable outlook on life. 

Due to their nomadic lifestyle, most halflings have taken up worship of [[Thrae]] gods and spirits, to better their chances of safe passage through wild lands, in particular gods and spirits of rivers and plains. Likewise, the nomadic lifestyle, surviving by trade and foraging from the land, does not lend itself to having many children, despite being potentially as prolific as humans. 

**1st era**
When the [[Atreans|Atrean]] gods arrived and began to dominate the most populous places lands and communities, though untrusting of the [[Atreans|Atrean]] gods, many nomadic halflings felt required to change their worship to still allow for the trade with other folk that their survival depends on. Therefore nominally, most halflings are [[Atreans|Atrean]] folk, though almost all still worship [[Thrae]] gods and spirits, particularly while traveling the wilds. 

**2nd Era**
After the [[Fall of the Divine Tower]], most communities and kingdoms withdrew and hardened their defenses against the growing threat of monsters and other dangers in the wilds. Halflings travelers still resolutely carried on their trade, even as such wandering became significantly more dangerous. For most communities, the arrival of a halfling caravan or river troop signals desperately needed supplies from far afield, as well as news and gossip of other places that is much harder to come by. Such visits are typically celebrated, and the tribes fortified with what supplies and defenses villages and kingdoms can spare. However, some places have grown paranoid and insular in these dark times, and are suspicious or outright hostile to any outsiders, including halfling traders. 

However, these hard times even caused some eternally restless Halflings to change their ways. Some decided to settle into quarters in other mortal settlements. Affectionately knowns as [[Eighths]], (a bit of Halfling humor), this areas of villages cities serve the interests of these smaller folk. However, even these Halflings cannot escape their wanderlust, and so even though the [[Eighths]] are permanent, rarely does any one family stay in one for more than a few years, and sometimes even as little as a few months. When they leave, they travel to another known safe city with an [[Eighths|Eighth]], thereby setting up a regular rotation of Halfling families bringing their expertise, news, and goods along known settlements.

**3rd Era**
The consolidation of powers in the 3rd Era under the [[Covenant of the Silver Dawn]] and the Azanite Empire generally benefited halfling nomads, who now had safer journeys through lands cleansed by Covenant magic or Azanite conquest, as well as other growing civilizations. However, as these powerful groups began to come into conflict, halfling traders found themselves pressured to support one group or another, and cut off trade with their enemies. 

**4th Era**
The [[Irithiel]] Empire becomes an unwelcome place for halflings, looked down upon by Elves who wish to supplant and control trade with their own means. Most nomadic halflings of this Era withdrew to wilder lands, as far as they could get from the empire’s reach. Those who had settled among other folk were relegated to lower classes along with most other non-elven folk.

#### Humans
**Origin**
Humans were the last of [[Ameti]]‘s children created before she seemingly disappeared. the shortest-lived of Ameti’s children, humans nevertheless were prolific, ambitious, and adaptable. They quickly spread to most lands in [[Threa]], sometimes as conquerors, other times as traders or settlers. Humans would go on to  become the most populous ancestry in [[Threa]].

**1st Era**
Humans were among the most likely to take up the [[Atreans|Atrean]] Gods on their offer of worship in exchange for boons and protection. With this newfound divine protection, humans were a great aid in the war against the [[Thrae]]. It also earned a negative reputation among [[Thrae]] supporters and even neutral parties.

**2nd Era**
The [[Fall of the Divine Tower]] and dark times of the 2nd Era forced many people into unlikely arrangements in order to survive. Many other folk who may have looked askance at human ambitious became thankful for their adaptability when forced to live with them in constrained, defensive communities.

**3rd Era**
With most other folk contracting into safeholds during the 2nd Era, the 3rd Era of conquest and stabilization saw humans taking advantage to become the leading folk in most of the lands. 

**4th Era**
Humans, like all non-Elves were looked down upon by the [[Irithiel]], however they could not deny the potential threat from humans from a sheer numbers perspective. [[Irithiel]] Elves were incredibly powerful, but like all Elves were relatively small in population, and slow to reproduce. Therefore they tended to treat with humans on a more even playing field, at least those they deemed suitable for leadership roles to keep their fellow humans in line.
