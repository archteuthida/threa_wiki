Covenant of Stolor

The Covenant of the Silver Dawn is an organization of sanctioned mages bound by a pact with divine warrior handlers. While the [[Silver Dawn]] hunted mages throughout the 1st and 2nd Eras, the Covenant itself formed late in the 2nd Era as a compromise toward arcane practitioners. Divine mage-hunters worshipping an [[Ascendant]] known as [[Stolor]] decided on an agreement with the mages they captured, allowing them limited study and practice of arcane arts as long as they are overseen and controlled by Silver Dawn paladins. Those mages that rejected this agreement are considered heretics and hunted without mercy. 

The Covenant lasted until the late 3rd Era, when it was broken by a combination of a mage uprising and the arrival of the [[Irithiel]] Elven Imperium.
