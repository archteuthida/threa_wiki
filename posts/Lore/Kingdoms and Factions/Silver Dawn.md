The Silver Dawn first formed the 1st Era under the auspices of a god tasked with hunting down blasphemous arcane mages. 

In the 2nd Era, after the [[Fall of the Divine Tower]], a devout follower named [[Stolor]] became an [[Ascendant]], and carried on the task of hunting arcane practitioners. He would later go on to soften his position toward arcane mages, and was key to developing the [[Covenant of the Silver Dawn]], as compromise that allowed mages to practice the arcane under the scrutiny of Silver Dawn guardians. 

Not all in the Silver Dawn agreed with this compromise. A splinter group of anti-arcane fanatics would go on to found the [[Hidden Hand]], and continue to hunt down those who used arcane magic whether they were part of the Covenant or not.
