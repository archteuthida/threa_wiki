Trade and currency varies across regions and times:

In the 1st and 2nd Eras, barter and trade is the most common among merchants and settlements. Anything from livestock to textiles, grain, and crafted items are used to transfer and represent wealth. However, this is not very convenient for adventurers and mercenaries, so a coinage was developed for portable currency. 

The general standard is the silver coin. These may be crafted or minted in various regions and styles, but a generally accepted weight is used making them acceptable anywhere. 

Sometimes other items of an equivalent value is used for portable payment, such as salt, or grain. 

When coins are used, they are minted of pure silver or gold. Therefore the practice of clipping coins is common. Each coin can get about 10 clips or slivers out of one. In places with strictly established mints, usually bigger kingdoms or empires in large cities, this practice is frowned upon, as it leads to loss of standards. Additionally sometimes mostly unclipped coins are passed off as their full value. Merchants and sellers might even accept such coins, reasoning it's better to have silver in hand than none. 

Gold coins are typically held by the wealthy. A gold coin is worth 10 silver.  Gold coins may also be subject to clipping, though usually when they find their way into the hands of those not accustomed to using them. Among the wealthy and aristocracy it is highly gauche to clip gold coins or use clipped coins, and high end merchants and others dealing in gold won't accept clipped coins. 

>Gold coins are also made, each representing 100 silver coins. These are typically only found in the hands of the wealthy or governments for the purposes of large wealth transfer. 

The other major currency is [[Shards]], fragments of magical power. These are of value to [[Hallowed]], or other seeking magical experimentation. Since common folk have no use for them they are willing to trade them for equivalent currency. Shards are common enough and yet in demand enough to balance their worth. One shard is equivalent to one silver piece.
