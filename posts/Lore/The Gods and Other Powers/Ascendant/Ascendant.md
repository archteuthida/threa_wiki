Ascendant are mortal beings who have achieved apotheosis, that is they have ascended to godhood. In the 1st Era any attempts for mortals to ascend is viewed as blasphemous, but in the 2nd Era after the exodus of the gods it was viewed by many as a necessity. Later faiths such as the Azanite faith welcome Ascendant willing to submit to Azan as Saints of their religion. 

There is another type of Ascendant that arose after the [[Fall of the Divine Tower]], an [[Avatar]]. Avatars are champions of a particular god or pantheon that have grown powerful enough to channel their divinity to a degree, and carry out their will on [[Threa]]. This process tends to channel a portion of the god into the mortal champion, subsuming their mind and personality, and so is only accepted by the most devoteed and powerful followers.
