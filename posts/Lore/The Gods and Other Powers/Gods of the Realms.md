The Gods are beings first formed by the [[Eldorim]] to carry out tasks in the material world, in which they cannot exist. These first, powerful gods are known as the [[Sigilbearers]], as the carry fundamental magic sigils that allow for powerful forces of creation and destruction. There are many tiers of god below this, based on their relation to the [[Sigilbearers]] and other factors. Direct children of the [[Sigilbearers]] are major gods, their children are minor gods. Children of the gods and mortals are demigods. Lastly, there are the least gods and Beggar gods. These last are more distant descendants, with vastly reduced influence and power. Still, any gods has potential for great power, and can improve their station with followers and their offerings.

## [[Sigilbearers]]


(Creastbearers?)

The [[Sigilbearers]] are the mightiest of gods. Given powerful magic sigils crafted from the words of the [[Litany of Creation]], they wield the power to shape the universe and create lifeâ€”or end it. Sigils are bequeathed from the [[Eldorim]] directly, who are the only ones known to have to power to form them.
