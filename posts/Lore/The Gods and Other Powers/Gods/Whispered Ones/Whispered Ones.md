The Whispered Ones are gods formed from [[The Dark]], and shaped by the [[Eldorim]]. They were sent to [[Threa]] when it formed to server as watchers and manipulators. 

Whispered Ones are dangerous, wild, and often unpredictable. They do not trade boons for worship as [[Atreans|Atrean]] gods do, they will always do what they will according to their nature. They may confer blessing upon mortals, but only if it serve their nature and interests. Mortals can attempt to summon the attention of Whispered Ones with offerings and sacrifices, but it is a dangerous gamble to do so. A Whispered One will evaluate the creature that has drawn its attention and act according to how it sees fit. This may benefit the summoner, but almost always has some other ramification.

Mortals that instead act in the interests of the Whispered Ones may find themselves given favor, or at least left alone. 

After the arrival of the [[Atreans|Atrean]] Gods, the Whispered Ones often fought against them, siding with the [[Thrae]]. However, not all joined this fight, and those that did, did so in a disorganized manner, so ultimately they failed to drive the [[Atreans]] away from [[Threa]]. After this conflict settled into uneasy peace, most Whispered Ones opted to leave [[Threa]] themselves, carving out individual demi-planes over which they had control, and influencing mortals from afar.
