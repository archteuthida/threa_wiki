The Thrae are the primal spirits of [[Threa]]. These spirits shaped the land and breathed the first life into existence, the plants and beasts and other wild things. They also formed the [[Fey]] and [[Giantkin]] from pure matter of [[Threa]], as well as the great Beast gods that defend the natural world.

Even though they are typically at odds, the Thrae often ally themselves with the [[Whispered Ones]], who were early gods who walked upon [[Threa]], against the [[Atreans]], a mutual enemy. 

Thrae, like all gods and Outsiders, have an interest in mortal souls. The Thrae in particular use their power to feed into [[Thrae]], burying mortal bodies in the roots of the great trees of the world.
