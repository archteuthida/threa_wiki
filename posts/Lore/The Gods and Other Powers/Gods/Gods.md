# Gods Overview

 
The Gods are formed from energy manifested where the [[Outer Realms]] meet. There are therefore four families of gods. Since Gods are formed from the [[Outer Realms]], they cannot abide the material world for long on their own. They begin to lose their power and go dormant. Each family of gods counteracts this in their own way.

Gods of the Flame
These gods form from the [[Endless Citadel]], where the [[Weft]] and [[Warp]] meet. Those who came to [[Threa]] to oversee mortals are known as the [[Atreans|Atrean]] Gods. These gods can maintain themselves on [[Threa]] with the connection to the [[Divine Tower]], itself maintained with offerings and sacrifices by mortals. They are generally associated with Divine magic.

Gods of the Void
Manifesting as [[The Stars]], these gods form on the border of [[The Dark]] and the Energy Planes. Few choose to fall to [[Threa]], but those that do can maintain themselves with arcane magic, especially aided by mortal casters. They are generally associated with Arcane magic.

Gods of Matter
Forming from the border of [[The Dark]] and the [[Churn]], gods from this family were the first to arrive on [[Threa]] and became the [[Thrae]]. These gods bound themselves to the land, and are sustained by the growth of wild life and nature. They can consign mortal souls to the land to aid in this energy. They are generally associated with Primal magic.

Gods of the Hidden
Forming from the border of the [[Churn]] and the [[Weft]] and [[Warp]], these gods are dangerous and unpredictable. Those who walked [[Threa]] are known as the [[Whispered Ones]]. These gods can maintain themselves on [[Threa]] by consuming mortal souls, though many choose to live in demi-planes of their own design closer to the [[outer realms]] to heed off decay. They are the progenitors of fiends, who try to sway mortals to claim their souls in various ways. They are generally associated with Occult magic.

Gods rarely are able to truly die. If a god is bereft of their power source, they usually enter a form of dormancy that takes various forms. Some ossify or become as stone, others may fade to etherealness, or become as an element. 

### Methods of Worship and Boons

Each group of gods manages their relationship with mortals in different ways. 

The [[Thrae]] act according to the best interests of nature and primal forces, they do not bargain or exchange worship for boons. However, a mortal acting in the interest of balance or defending nature may receive blessings from [[Thrae]] gods, simply as a matter of expediency. The [[Thrae]] are quick to turn on anyone who acts against their interests, despite any past alignment with their goals.

The [[Atreans]] provide the fairest trade or worship and offerings by mortals to receiving boons or benefits. For this reason, the [[Atreans]] have become the most popular gods amongst mortal kind. However, even these gods are fickle, not to mention changing rivalries and alliances with other [[Atreans|Atrean]] gods, which can influence the effects and fortunes of worshippers. The most common form of worship for most people is providing offerings of money, goods, and sacrifices of beasts. The more value to the offeror, the better the boon. Sacrifice of other mortals is frowned upon, both from a philosophical and practical standpoint of the civilization [[Atreans]] seek to create.

[[Whispered Ones]] welcome worship—on their terms. They hunger for it and demand sacrifice from those who would worship them, including the sacrifice of other mortals. They greedily accept such offerings, and in return provide whatever dark blessings they see fit, if they deign to do so at all. This makes [[Whispered Ones]] rarely worshipped, sought after only by the desperate or mad, or by cults where leaders reap the benefits at the expense of their underlings.

The gods of [[The Stars]] are distant and mysterious. They work matters of Fate with little concern for worship of mortals. Since they rarely even step foot on [[Threa]], they have little motivation to seek worship or provide blessings in return, though they may occasionally grant boons to those devoted to reading the stars and fate if it serves to carry out fate’s path.
