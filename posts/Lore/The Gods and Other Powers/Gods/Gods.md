# Gods Overview

 
The Gods are manifested in the Other World, the [[Echo Realm]]. Being of pure metaphysical energy, they cannot abide the material realm of [[Threa]] for long before beginning to lose their power and go dormant. Each family of gods counteracts this in their own way.

[[Atreans]]
Children of [[Volar]], the Flame. Those who came to [[Threa]] to oversee mortals are known as the [[Atreans|Atrean]] Gods. These gods can maintain themselves on [[Threa]] with the connection to the [[Divine Tower]], itself maintained with offerings and sacrifices by mortals. They are generally associated with Divine magic.

[[The Stars]]
It is questionable whether the Stars can truly be called gods, though they are undoubtedly beings with great power. The Stars were a gift from [[Und-Enan Endures Eternally]] to [[Aedai Speaks the Primordial Word]], and they oversee fate of all their light shines upon. The stars appear in the skies above most realms, individually or as constellations, which change throughout the seasons. However there is another, mysterious set of stars that hang over the [[Echo Realm]], cold, and unchanging. These are typically associated with death and the afterlife to mortals. There are said be  three beings of fate that manifest in mortal appearance to interact with gods and mortals alike. These beings are feared and respected by god and mortal alike, except those who attempt to spurn fate entirely. Otherwise, the Stars are aloof, manifesting their power over their long distance without any concern over the prayers of those below. Occasionally one will fall from the sky and land on [[Threa]], typically an ill portent and the sign of a mad Star that will rampage across the land until contained or destroyed.

[[Thrae]]
Gods from this family were the first to arrive on [[Threa]] after [[Shardfall]] and became the [[Thrae]]. These gods bound themselves to the land, and are sustained by the growth of wild life and nature. They can consign mortal souls to the land to aid in this energy. They are generally associated with Primal magic.

[[Whispered Ones]]
These gods are dangerous and unpredictable, and most spurn fate and [[The Stars]], seeking their own path. These gods can maintain themselves on [[Threa]] by consuming mortal souls, though many choose to live in demi-planes of their own design which appear as planets in [[Threa]]‘s sky or to stalk the dark, quiet places of the [[Echo Realm]]. This distance affords them more safety, but at a cost of lesser influence. Most [[Whispered Ones]] can give their dark boons to only a few mortals at a time. They are the progenitors of fiends, who try to sway mortals to claim their souls in various ways. They are generally associated with Occult magic.

Gods rarely are able to truly die. If a god is bereft of their power source, they usually enter a form of dormancy that takes various forms. Some ossify or become as stone, others may fade to etherealness, or become as an element. Others simply appear as mortal beings, still immortal yet separated from their powerful magic and gifts, and vulnerable to being killed.

### Methods of Worship and Boons

Each group of gods manages their relationship with mortals in different ways. 

The [[Thrae]] act according to the best interests of nature and primal forces, they do not bargain or exchange worship for boons. However, a mortal acting in the interest of balance or defending nature may receive blessings from [[Thrae]] gods, simply as a matter of expediency. The [[Thrae]] are quick to turn on anyone who acts against their interests, despite any past alignment with their goals.

The [[Atreans]] provide the fairest trade or worship and offerings by mortals to receiving boons or benefits. For this reason, the [[Atreans]] have become the most popular gods amongst mortal kind. However, even these gods are fickle, not to mention changing rivalries and alliances with other [[Atreans|Atrean]] gods, which can influence the effects and fortunes of worshippers. The most common form of worship for most people is providing offerings of money, goods, and sacrifices of beasts. The more value sacrificed by the supplicant, the better the boon. Sacrifice of other mortals is frowned upon, both from a philosophical and practical standpoint of the civilization [[Atreans]] seek to create.

[[Whispered Ones]] welcome worship—on their terms. They hunger for it and demand sacrifice from those who would worship them, including the sacrifice of other mortals. They greedily accept such offerings, and in return provide whatever dark blessings they see fit, if they deign to do so at all. Typically such gifts are provided to drive mortals to further the cause of the god providing the gift, and is rarely, if ever, truly beneficial to the receiver in the long term. This makes [[Whispered Ones]] rarely worshipped, sought after only by the desperate or mad, or by cults where leaders reap the benefits at the expense of their underlings. Fiends, hags, and dark fey are often servants of such gods, proxies for their will to interface with mortals. These beings gain their power with fewer strings attached, if they can continue to provide mortal souls.

The gods of [[The Stars]] are distant and mysterious. They work matters of Fate with little concern for worship of mortals. Since they rarely even step foot on [[Threa]], they have little motivation to seek worship or provide blessings in return, though they may occasionally grant boons to those devoted to reading the stars and fate if it serves to carry out fate’s path.
