# Atra Overview
 
 
Atra is a catchall term, used by [[Thrae]] to describe those who are not native to [[Threa]]. However, one set of such gods, the Children of the Flame, have taken the label, often thrown as an insult by [[Thrae]], and embraced it, calling themselves the Atreans or Atrean gods, and are therefore the most closely associated with it. 

The Atrean Gods are the Children of the Flame, formed in the [[Echo Realm]]. When they arrived on [[Threa]], they brought with them [[Volar]], the Sun and physical embodiment of the Flame, which obscured [[The Stars]] and weakened their influence. The Moon, [[Inaeris]], was in turn, sent to destroy the sun, which fled. Thus the cycle of day and night began. The Atrean gods, who meant no offense to [[The Stars]], did not try to interfere with this cycle, as long as the sun could keep ahead of the moon.

The Atrean gods, like all gods, are weakened and rebuffed by the material realm. Unlike the [[Thrae]], the did not bind themselves to the land and nature, but to mortals and their civilization instead. To this end they could use the worship and offerings of mortals to stabilize their presence on [[Threa]]. In return, they offered generous boons and protection to mortals who were willing to provide such worship. Many mortal communities flocked to the new gods, seeing more benevolent rulers than the aloof [[Thrae]] or the dangerous [[Whispered Ones]].  

The manifestation of this compact is the [[Divine Tower]], which build a bridge to the [[Echo Realm]], much as the roots of [[Enâ€™Taia]] does for the [[Thrae]].
