The Atrean Gods are the Children of the Flame, formed from the chaos of the [[Churn]] and shaped by the [[Eldorim]]. They served in the [[Endless Citadel]] for eons, before traveling to [[Threa]] after [[Shardfall]]. 

When they arrived on [[Threa]], they brought with them [[Volar]], the Sun and physical embodiment of the Flame.

>Atra is a catchall term, used by [[Thrae]] to describe those who are not native to [[Threa]]. However, these foreign gods have taken the label, often thrown as an insult by [[Thrae]], and embraced it, calling themselves the Atreans or Atrean gods. 

>The most prominent contingent of Atra on [[Threa]] is the pantheon of [[Volar]], the sacred flame, that would become [[Threa]]â€˜s sun, and lead by [[Ashilem]].
