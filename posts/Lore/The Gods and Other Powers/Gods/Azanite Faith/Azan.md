Azan is a god that is three as one: their full names are Atris-Ydis-Orani. In fact, Azan is the creation of a powerful [[Eldorim]], possibly the last living one, who bound themselves to two other gods. 

Azan seeks to be worshipped by mortals in the wake other the retraction of other gods in the 2nd Era. They wait in the [[Outer Realms]] and [[Lost Roads]], unable to enter [[Threa]] until X is met. However, they can still grant powerful boons to their worshippers, in contrast to the limited blessings left by [[Atreans|Atrean]] gods. 

To this end Azanite followers seek to fulfill the conditions of their entry into [[Threa]], as well as subsume existing gods and [[Ascendant]]s under their faith as saints. 

They have most successfully accomplished this as zealous evangelists for their faith, demonstrating the power that Azan has granted them. They influence and sway rulers of the various kingdoms and city-states, winning the rulers to their cause and faith, and uniting them under rule of the Azanite clergy (or at least provide a strong authority that the mundane rulers must reckon with). 

In addition to the demonstrations of divine magic offered by Azanite clerics, they have been most successful with their persuasion by demonstrating an ability to heal rifts into [[The Pale]], reconnecting the lands of [[Threa]] to a limited extent.
