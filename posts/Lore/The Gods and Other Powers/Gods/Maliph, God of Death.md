Maliph is the child of [[Issinia Slowly Unweaves in Silence]] and [[Ameti]]. Born with divinity and the power of unmaking, he is able to bring death to mortal kind, separating their bodies from souls. He sometimes serves as a psychopomp, carrying souls to the [[Ethereal plane]]. 

Maliph first carried out his calling out of jealousy of the [[Ametian Folk]], being the other children of [[Ameti]]. But after an age, he decided to put such feeling behind him. However, when he did so, he discovered mortals who do not die as they should are consigned to a horrifying fate: their bodies fail and decay around them, yet they do not die. 

The brief period he waylaid his cause is said to be the origin of the first liches and other corrupt undead.

They sometimes become corrupt undead in such a case. So, Maliph once again took up his duties, and severs mortal souls so that the natural cycle can continue.
