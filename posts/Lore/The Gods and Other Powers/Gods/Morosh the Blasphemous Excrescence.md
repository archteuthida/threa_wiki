When the [[Eldorim]] failed to be humbled by their newfound mortality at the hands of [[Issinia Slowly Unravels in Silence]], [[Aedai Speaks the Primordial Word]] sent a more direct attack on them in the form of Morosh, a monster of chaos and destruction the only way Aedai knew how to make. Morosh creates in an controlled and twisted way, transforming anything it touches into chaotic new growth, like a cancer. 

The [[Eldorim]] it faced were excruciatingly transformed into new forms, most of which quickly killed the victims. Those that survived faced a worse fate: turned into twisted abominations that lashed out mindlessly at everything around them. Many still lurk, trapped deep in ancient [[Eldorim]] ruins or wandering the [[Lost Roads]]. 

Morosh also laid waste to the great structures of the [[Eldorim]], including the [[Lost Roads]]. Where it touched, fractal formations of matter bloomed, disfiguring and destroying the surrounding area. 

Moroshâ€™s nature of unbridled creation was antithetical to even [[Issinia Slowly Unravels in Silence]], who could not bear to face it. However, she did her best to stymie its outgrowth children, and the [[Eldorim]] abominations formed by contact with it. Eventually, when [[Aedai Speaks the Primordial Word]] saw the [[Eldorim]] were no more, he flung Morosh out to the [[Dark Beyond the Stars]], so that it would not threaten the rest of creation.
