# The Stars Overview
 

 
Gods that live high in [[The Dark]], and take the form of constellations. These gods manage fate, and confer powers of prophecy and divination. They prefer their lofty heights as opposed to traveling to [[Threa]], though sometimes individual stars are cast down on the material world, which act as messengers, monsters, or other tools of fate.
