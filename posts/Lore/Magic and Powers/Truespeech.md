After [[Aedai Speaks the Primordial Word]], spoke the world into existence, the [[Litany of Creation]] echoed through the cosmos for some time after. The first [[Dragons and Dragonkin]], the Great Wyrms, studied this great naming of things and created Truespeech, the most elemental and powerful magic in existence, and the most taxing to perform. 

Truespeech can never be a lie, by speaking Truespeech it makes that reality true... if the speaker is strong enough. If not, the failure can be catastrophic. 

Later dragons would go on to form Draconic, a derivative of Truespeech that has less power but still forms the basis of magical speech. Arcane magi often ise Draconic as the foundation of their verbal and written casting, though it is not the only way to cast magic with language.
