### Creation
In the beginning there was nothing but the swirling dark sea of chaos before time, called [[Und-Enan Endures Eternally]]. Eventually, a being formed in these dark waters, and was called [[Aedai Speaks the Primordial Word]]. Und-Enan thought of Aedai as her child, and in their infancy sung him lullabies of true names, the Song of Creation.  When Aedai grew to adulthood, he was lonely, as [[Und-Enan Endures Eternally]] would rarely speak, instead enduring in silence outside of the world and time as she always had. [[Aedai Speaks the Primordial Word]] organized the lullabies she sang into a litany, and began to use them to create the world.

Thus, the universe was spoken into creation by [[Aedai Speaks the Primordial Word]], with the [[Litany of Creation]]. But [[Aedai Speaks the Primordial Word]] found each time he Spoke, a natural counterbalance of unmaking would claim his creation shortly thereafter. 

In frustration, [[Aedai Speaks the Primordial Word]] channeled all unmaking and forced it into a form: the being [[Issinia Slowly Unravels in Silence]]. Thus bound, [[Aedai Speaks the Primordial Word]] was able to create the universe, even knowing that [[Issinia Slowly Unravels in Silence]] was fated to end it all, someday, returning the universe to [[Und-Enan Endures Eternally]]. 

He spoke into existence the world, [[Threa]], land and sea, and the sky above. [[Und-Enan Endures Eternally]] was proud of [[Aedai Speaks the Primordial Word]]‘s achievement, and as a gift gave the world [[The Stars]] to shine overhead and govern the fate of all things they shone their light upon. So too was created the other layers of the universe: The [[High Realms]], [[The Dark]] which held the Stars, the [[Echo Realm]] which mirrored [[Threa]], and [[The Underworld]], that would be the land of the dead, with its great [[Silent Sea]] and the home of [[Issinia Slowly Unravels in Silence]]. Finally, [[Aedai Speaks the Primordial Word]] built for themselves a high throne on which to watch and govern their universe, the [[Endless Citadel]], in the [[High Realms]] above.

[[Aedai Speaks the Primordial Word]] looked over their creation and wept at its beauty. Where their tears landed on the realms beings formed: the gods and [[Eldorim]]. In the [[high realms]] of Aedai’s [[Endless Citadel]] formed the [[Atreans|Atrean]] Gods, on the [[Echo Realm]] formed the [[Thrae]] spirits. rivulets formed a mighty river to [[the underworld]], from the banks of which formed the [[Whispered Ones]]. And from the tears mixing with the soil of [[Threa]] formed the [[Eldorim]]. 

### The Unbroken Age
Thus began the first Age of [[Threa]]: The [[Unbroken Era]]. This age is defined by the empire of the [[Eldorim]], the workings of the [[Fey]] courts, the great [[Giantkin]] kingdoms, and the power of the [[Dragons and Dragonkin|Dragons]].

The [[Eldorim]], the first people, were powerful and immortal and gifted in the ways of arcane magic. They quickly spread across [[Threa]] in a vast empire, developing sophisticated magitech creations, labyrinthine cities, and strange monuments to their own. They respected the gods, but did not worship them, seeing them instead as equals. Instead, they built temples to the strongest of their own kind, who they considered ascended. In their time the gods remained mostly in their own realms, and so they had only the wild beasts of nature and the mighty dragons to contend with. 

In time it came to be that three acts of the [[Eldorim]] would turn them against their creator, [[Aedai Speaks the Primordial Word]], and lead to their destruction.

First, the [[Eldorim]], tired of living in eternal night, sought to light up their world. They asked the [[Atreans]] for a portion of the holy flame, [[Volar]], that lights the halls of the [[Endless Citadel]]. In trade they would give the [[Atreans]] powerful arcane relics as tools and weapons. The [[Atreans]] agreed, and set alight a golden orb with the flame of [[Volar]], which was set in the sky above [[Threa]] as its sun, [[Eb Volar]]. [[The Stars]], their light obscured by this sun, were furious to see their influence negated. They petitioned [[Aedai Speaks the Primordial Word]] for their grievance, and [[Aedai Speaks the Primordial Word]] agreed. He gathered an orb of stone, and filled it with [[The Stars]] light, and hurled it at the new sun seeking to destroy it. Instead, the [[Eldorim]] cast a spell to set the sun in motion, fleeing from this moon [[Inaeris]], and thus began the cycle of day and night. Realizing their offence, they offered this cycle as a compromise: they would gain the light of day for half the cycle, and yet at night [[The Stars]] influence could still be felt. Mollified, [[The Stars]] agreed, and [[Aedai Speaks the Primordial Word]]let the matter rest. It is said if the Moon [[Inaeris]] ever catches the sun it will be annihilated, and the strength of Star-driven fate will return in full force to [[Threa]]. 

Second, seeking to reach new realms, the [[Eldorim]] crafted great roads between planes and worlds using their art, even reaching the halls of the [[Endless Citadel]] itself. These would later become known as the [[Lost Roads]]. [[Aedai Speaks the Primordial Word]] felt this was a step to far, their sacred realm being off-limits to the [[Eldorim]] and did not stand for this impertinence of their creation. They sent [[Issinia Slowly Unravels in Silence]] to punish the [[Eldorim]]. [[Issinia Slowly Unravels in Silence]] visited the emperor of the [[Eldorim]]. She appeared with compassion and love, and embraced this leader. Between them was born her child, [[Maliph, God of Death]], and from that point on the [[Eldorim]] became mortal. Their people would now succumb to age and illness and their physical forms would fail, leaving their souls behind where their bodies fell. 

Rather than deterring the [[Eldorim]], this act caused them to drive on toward their goals with all the more fervor. In time, the hubris of the [[Eldorim]] grew such that they would seek to conquer all the realms, and even challenge [[Aedai Speaks the Primordial Word]] themselves for their power. In a rage, [[Aedai Speaks the Primordial Word]] tricked [[Issinia Slowly Unravels in Silence]] into learning a word of Ending, and spoke it; Sinking the vast [[Eldorim]] cities beneath the ground and wiping out their people leaving their souls to haunt the lands. The continent of the [[Heart of Threa]] was shattered into vast islands. However, destruction was not [[Aedai Speaks the Primordial Word]]‘s’ domain, and this act sent a crack of weakness throughout them, like a dropped glass.

[[Issinia Slowly Unravels in Silence]], already resenting the pain she had caused the [[Eldorim]], was horrified at this genocide. She confronted [[Aedai Speaks the Primordial Word]], and, spying their weakness, shattered him in turn. In an event known as [[Shardfall]], the fragments of his body sundered his throne, the [[Endless Citadel]] and the [[Lost Roads]]. Smaller shards dusted [[Threa]] and the other realms. These shards dealt more destruction, this time not only to [[Threa]]. At the edges of the [[Heart of Threa]] were cleaved massive chasms clean through to [[Und-Enan Endures Eternally]] herself, separating the far reaches of the world apart. The [[Endless Citadel]], and the [[Lost Roads]] roads, the [[Echo Realm]] and even [[The Underworld]] all suffered similar damage, either broken apart or creating great wounds through to the primordial chaos. All such rifts were scarred over with [[The Pale]].

It is said that [[Und-Enan Endures Eternally]] grieved mightily the loss of her child Aedai, though in seething silence. This grief manifested as strange and dangerous creatures of chaos swimming in her dark waters, the [[Eldvessen]]. These roiled up through the wounds in the realms, but were lost and aimless in [[The Pale]], and so trapped there.

### The Arrival of the Gods
In the [[Echo Realm]], closest to [[Threa]], the [[Thrae]] gods had lived and already established their own creations, the plants, beasts, fey, and giants. These were formed from [[En’Taia]], the Great Spirit, whose three children were great [[Thrae]] spirits: [[Eionys]], Mother of [[Fey]] and Wilds, and [[Wargha]], the Mountain King, father of [[Giantkin]], and [[Mephwar]], the Golden Stag, ruler of Beasts. These spirit gods had children of their own, which created all the wild things in nature, the Fey and the Giants. The borders of the [[Echo Realm]] and [[Threa]] are thin and permeable, especially in the wild places, and the bounties of the [[Thrae]] creations populated [[Threa]] as well. The [[Eldorim]] and [[Thrae]] co-existed, the [[Eldorim]] reaping the benefits of nature and respecting its boundaries, while still pursuing their own power. 

Now that the [[Eldorim]] were gone, the [[Thrae]] sought to inherit rule of both lands. The [[Thrae]] have always relied on the connection to the [[Echo Realm]] to survive, these connections most often coming through the roots of the Great Trees, which entangle [[En’Taia]]‘s roots in the [[Echo Realm]]. Without these tethers the spirits would fade and dissipate, and many spirits feel the need to journey to the other realm to recharge.

The [[Thrae]] are bound to the land, and it is the source of their magic and power. Spirits infuse all things on [[Threa]], from mountains and forests, to rivers and beasts. But spirits are flighty and wild, and dissipate quickly when not bound to physical matter of the material world. Thus [[Fey]] and [[Giantkin]], though immortal, can still be killed, and when they do they cannot be brought back or live on in an afterlife. Spirits also draw their power from [[Threa]] and the [[Echo Realm]], so those removed to other planes fade and die. 

#### Ameti
[[Ameti]] is an [[Atreans||Atrean]] god who’s talent is soul shaping. Shaped souls were in high demand in the realms outside [[Threa]], where Outsider beings made of souls of [[Eldorim]] felled in the outer realms found use as servitors and warriors to the other gods, and so [[Ameti]]‘s gift was always in high demand.

#### Mortals
[[Issinia Slowly Unravels in Silence]] fell in love with [[Ameti]], who fell in love with her in return. However, [[Issinia Slowly Unravels in Silence]]’s closeness with [[Ameti]] rendered her mortal. This mortality meant that [[Ameti]] could no longer produce infinite new beings, each creature created stole some of her now limited life. In order to escape the [[outer realms]] and their demand for soul shaping, [[Ameti]] and [[Issinia Slowly Unravels in Silence]] fled to [[Threa]], hidden from the other gods. [[Issinia Slowly Unravels in Silence]] then left for the [[Far Shore]], to distance herself from her love and prevent further damage. 

On [[Threa]], [[Ameti]] discovered the multitude of souls in  [[The Underworld]] left behind from the [[Eldorim]], and set about shaping them into the folk who would become known as the children of [[Ameti]], or [[Ametian Folk]].

##### Elves
After an eon wandering [[Threa]], [[Ameti]] crafted souls to create the children she always wanted with her love. She gathers souls and wove heartwood from the trees of wild forests of [[En’Taia]] around them, pouring much of her remaining mortality into them. Thus were formed the Elves, long-lived thanks to [[Ameti]]’s generous infusion of life. The elves were embraced by the [[Fey]], and lived among them while also spreading across the land, only to be plagued by [[Goblinkin]] as a result of another god’s meddling.

##### Dwarves
After another eon, [[Ameti]] shaped living stone around more souls, forming the Dwarves. More judicious now with her life power, the dwarves had a shorter, though still long lifespan. Some dug deep into the mountains to make their homes, while others helped their Elven kindred building the beautiful and intricate [[Treeholds]].

##### Halflings
The next children [[Ameti]] formed from dirt and water to create Halflings. She gave less of her life to these, feeling the limits of her mortality. They were flighty and wandering due to their composition, and traveled in nomadic groups all across the land.

##### Humans
The last children [[Ameti]] formed were out of clay and water, more sturdy than dirt and yet still adaptable, which became humans. She spared what little of her mortality she could for these last, resulting in the shortest lifespan of all her children. Still, humans made up for their short lives with innovation and adaptability, as well as prolific offspring.

##### Mortals and Death
The unique combination of souls and matter from the material plane used to form mortals created a unforeseen effect: when mortals had offspring. And so, mortal kind multiplied and spread through [[Threa]]. 

In [[Issinia Slowly Unravels in Silence]]‘s first child, [[Maliph, God of Death]], still haunted [[Threa]]. When mortals were formed, he took up his role once again. The life force that [[Ameti]] poured into each creation held [[Maliph, God of Death]] at bay, for a time, but in the end he would claim each mortal life, though he could not destroy their souls. 

However, now that the gods existed, they had use for mortal souls after their death. Each god or group of gods had a motivation to channel these souls from [[Threa]] to their own ends.

##### Early Mortal Life
The [[Thrae]] gods were bound by the world and acted only according to their natures. To exist harmoniously with them required a restricted lifestyle, that respected the natural order. Attempts at  growing civilizations that unbalanced this order brought mortals into conflict with the [[Thrae]], for which they had little ability to counteract. Thus the [[Thrae]] gods were seen by many mortals as harsh and unforgiving gods. Other mortals found a more harmonious balance with the [[Thrae]], offered thanks and respect, and were left alone. But life was hard even for those who adhered to these restrictions.

Other occult gods known as the [[Whispered Ones]], dwelling in the shadows of [[Thrae]] or in [[The Underworld]] below, offered tempting bargains of power to mortals, but the price was always high. Such mortal that accepted these bargains often became threats that others rallied to destroy, or cautionary tales for others not to bargain with the dark powers.

Still, despite the hardships they faced, early mortals were able to spread and form communities, kingdoms, and even empires.

#### The Arrival of the Atra
When the [[Endless Citadel]] was shattered by [[Shardfall]], the [[Atreans]] remaining rebuilt what they could from the rubble. Still, scars and ruin remains across the great city, and the flames of [[Volar]] are naught but dim embers, leaving the city in perpetual twilight. The maintenance of the city and the [[Atreans]] power relied on the souls of the fallen [[Eldorim]], shaped and pressed into service as celestials and other servitors.

After a time, [[Ameti]]’s absence and the spread of mortals on [[Threa]] did not go unnoticed. [[Ashilem]] and his children, the [[Atreans]], traveled to the world with the intent of ruling over mortal kind. 

As with the [[Thrae]], the Atrean gods needed a way to stabilize themselves in the material worlds. Instead of binding themselves to nature, they bound themselves to mortals and their cities and civilizations. This bond as embodied by a great tower that reached above the clouds, known as the [[Divine Tower]].

When they arrived on [[Threa]], the [[Atreans]] began converting mortals to their worship, offering great boons and magic in exchange for offerings and devotion. This exchange was eagerly accepted by most mortals, with the promise of better lives under more forgiving gods than the [[Thrae]], and safer than the [[Whispered Ones]]. In exchange their worship and offerings bolstered the gods and allowed them to maintain their existence on [[Threa]]. 

Additionally, the [[Atreans]] would whisk away the souls of their worshippers to the [[Endless Citadel]] upon death, where they could serve in prayer to strengthen the gods and that city.

##### The War of Thrae and Atreans
The [[Thrae]] were outraged by this invasion of new gods and their influence. Furthermore, their conversion of mortals to their worship decreased souls to offer to [[Threa]]. They went to war against the [[Atreans|Atrean]] gods. 

Mortal folk now had to make a choice of which gods they would follow, [[Thrae]], [[Atreans]], or neither, though most choose one side or the other. It was not uniform amongst any ancestry as well—there were clans, tribes, and kingdoms of nearly every ancestry that aligned with one side or the other.

With the [[Atreans|Atrean]] arrival began 1st Recorded Era, and the second age, the [[1st Era]].
