### Creation
In the beginning the universe was spoken into creation by [[Aedai Speaks the Primordial Word]], with the [[Litany of Creation]]. But [[Aedai Speaks the Primordial Word]] found each time they Spoke, a natural counterbalance of unmaking would claim their creation shortly thereafter. 

In frustration, [[Aedai Speaks the Primordial Word]] channeled all unmaking and forced it into a form, the being [[Issinia Slowly Unweaves in Silence]]. Thus bound, [[Aedai Speaks the Primordial Word]] was able to create the universe, even knowing that [[Issinia Slowly Unweaves in Silence]] was fated to end it all, someday. 

They spoke into existence four fundamental planes: [[The Dark]], the [[Churn]], The [[Weft]] and the [[Warp]]. Where these planes met formed new planes and energies, and at their nexus was formed [[Threa]], the material plane.

In a time before the gods, there first came the [[Eldorim]], meant to be the perfect folk created by [[Aedai Speaks the Primordial Word]] to populate the universe. Formed from all the essences of the universe, these people quickly spread across [[Threa]] in a vast and powerful empire, developing sophisticated magitech creations, labyrinthine cities, and strange monuments to their own. They worshipped no gods, for there were no gods yet, except for Aedai and Issinia. Instead, they built temples to the strongest of their own kind, who they considered ascended. 

In time, the hubris of the [[Eldorim]] grew, such that they would challenge [[Aedai Speaks the Primordial Word]] themself for their power. They built vast roads interconnecting the realms, in order to reach [[Aedai Speaks the Primordial Word]]‘s throne. These would become the [[Lost Roads]]. 

[[Aedai Speaks the Primordial Word]] did not stand for this impertinence of their creation. They sent [[Issinia Slowly Unweaves in Silence]] to punish the [[Eldorim]]. [[Issinia Slowly Unweaves in Silence]] visited the emperor of the [[Eldorim]], who lead the challenge for supremacy. She appeared with compassion and love, and embraced this leader. From that moment the [[Eldorim]] knew death, her firstborn, [[Maliph, God of Death]], and became mortal. Their people would now succumb to age and illness and their physical forms would fail, leaving their souls behind on [[Threa]]. 

Rather than deterring the [[Eldorim]], this act caused them to drive on with all the more fervor. In a rage, [[Aedai Speaks the Primordial Word]] spoke a word of chaos, and shattered [[Threa]], sinking the vast [[Eldorim]] cities beneath the ground and wiping out their people, leaving their souls to haunt [[Threa]].

[[Issinia Slowly Unweaves in Silence]], already resenting the pain she had caused the [[Eldorim]], was horrified at this genocide. She confronted [[Aedai Speaks the Primordial Word]], and, using the power of her very essence, shattered him in turn. The fragments of his body sundered his throne and the [[Lost Roads]], and the pieces that landed in the outer realms would become the gods. Smaller shards dusted [[Threa]] and the other realms.

### The Growth of Threa
In time the gods formed from the outer realms. First to arrive on [[Threa]] were those who would become known as the [[Thrae]], formed from bountiful life and chaos. When they arrived, they felt the nature of [[Threa]] dissolving their metaphysical forms, and so sought a way to stabilize themselves. To do so they bound themselves with the land, so that their power flowed to and from it and refreshed itself with the natural cycles of wild life in the form of spirits. 

[[En’Taia]], the Great Spirit, grew with life on the material world, from which emerged three [[Thrae]] spirits: [[Eionys]], Mother of [[Fey]] and Wilds, and [[Wargha]], the Mountain King, father of [[Giantkin]], and X, ruler of Beasts. [[En’Taia]] herself took the form of a great tree, her roots burrowing deep into the world where her energy created spirits that inhabited the world and flitted among the wilds.

The [[Thrae]] are bound to the land, and it is the source of their magic and power. Spirits infused all things on [[Threa]], from mountains and forests, to rivers and beasts. But Spirits are flighty and wild, and dissipate quickly when not bound to physical matter of the material world. Thus [[Fey]] and [[Giantkin]], though immortal can still be killed, and when they do they cannot be brought back or live on in an afterlife, as with beasts and other wild things. Spirits also draw their power from [[Threa]] itself, so those removed to other planes fade and die.

Soon, the first gods from beyond were attracted to the life on [[Threa]]. These ancient, dark, and capricious gods were the [[Whispered Ones]], who wandered the land, outcast from other realms. So too arrived the [[Dragons and Dragonkin|Dragons]] who found the stability of [[Threa]] to their liking.

### The Unbroken Age
Thus went the first Age of [[Threa]]: The [[Unbroken Era]]. This age is defined by the workings of the [[Fey]] courts, the great [[Giantkin]] kingdoms, and the power of the [[Dragons and Dragonkin|Dragons]], as well as the arrival of [[Ameti]], the Soul Whisperer and mother of mortals.

#### Ameti
[[Ameti]] is an [[Atreans||Atrean]] god who’s talent is soul shaping. Shaped souls were in high demand in the realms outside [[Threa]], where creatures beings such as fiends and celestials made of souls of [[Eldorim]] felled in the outer realms found use as servitors and warriors to the other gods, and so [[Ameti]]‘s gift was always in high demand.

#### Mortals
[[Issinia Slowly Unweaves in Silence]] fell in love with [[Ameti]], who fell in love with her in return. However, [[Issinia Slowly Unweaves in Silence]]’s closeness with [[Ameti]] rendered her mortal. This mortality meant that [[Ameti]] could no longer produce infinite new beings, each creature created stole some of her now limited life. In order to escape the [[outer realms]] and their demand for soul shaping, [[Ameti]] and [[Issinia Slowly Unweaves in Silence]] fled to [[Threa]], hidden from the other gods. [[Issinia Slowly Unweaves in Silence]] then left for the [[Far Shore]], to distance herself from her love and prevent further damage. 

On [[Threa]], [[Ameti]] discovered the multitude of souls left behind from the [[Eldorim]], and set about shaping them into the folk who would become known as the children of [[Ameti]], or [[Ametian Folk]].

##### Elves
After an eon wandering [[Threa]], [[Ameti]] crafted souls to create the children she always wanted with her love. She gathers souls and wove heartwood from the trees of wild forests of [[En’Taia]] around them, pouring much of her remaining mortality into them. Thus were formed the Elves, long-lived thanks to [[Ameti]]’s generous infusion of life. The elves were embraced by the [[Fey]], and lived among them while also spreading across the land, only to be plagued by [[Goblinkin]] as a result of another god’s meddling.

##### Dwarves
After another eon, [[Ameti]] shaped living stone around more souls, forming the Dwarves. More judicious now with her life power, the dwarves had a shorter, though still long lifespan. Some dug deep into the mountains to make their homes, while others helped their Elven kindred building the beautiful and intricate [[Treeholds]].

##### Halflings
The next children [[Ameti]] formed from dirt and water to create Halflings. She gave less of her life to these, feeling the limits of her mortality. They were flighty and wandering due to their composition, and traveled in nomadic groups all across the land.

##### Humans
The last children [[Ameti]] formed were out of clay and water, more sturdy than dirt and yet still adaptable, which became humans. She spared what little of her mortality she could for these last, resulting in the shortest lifespan of all her children. Still, humans made up for their short lives with innovation and adaptability, as well as prolific offspring.

##### Mortals and Death
The unique combination of souls and matter from the material plane used to form mortals created a unforeseen effect: when mortals had offspring. And so, mortal kind multiplied and spread through [[Threa]]. 

In [[Issinia Slowly Unweaves in Silence]]‘s first child, [[Maliph, God of Death]], still haunted [[Threa]]. When mortals were formed, he took up his role once again. The life force that [[Ameti]] poured into each creation held [[Maliph, God of Death]] at bay, for a time, but in the end he would claim each mortal life, though he could not destroy their souls. 

However, now that the gods existed, they had use for mortal souls after their death. Each god or group of gods had a motivation to channel these souls from [[Threa]] to their own ends.

##### Early Mortal Life

The [[Thrae]] gods were bound by the world and acted only according to their natures. To exist harmoniously with them required a restricted lifestyle, that respected the natural order. Attempts at  growing civilizations that unbalanced this order brought mortals into conflict with the [[Thrae]], for which they had little ability to counteract. Thus the [[Thrae]] gods were seen by many mortals as harsh and unforgiving gods.

Some other occult gods, dwelling in the shadows of [[Thrae]] or in the [[Echo Realm]] below, offered tempting bargains to mortals, but the price was always high. Still, early mortals were able to multiply and form communities, kingdoms, even empires.

#### The First Portentous Event
[[Issinia Slowly Unweaves in Silence]] confronted Diadem, not content with her lot of being the [[Eldorim]] of destruction. When she was unable to change her fate, she used her power to destroy them, shattering the [[Eldorim]] and with them the lands above and below. The fragments of Diadem were flung through the universe, spreading destruction in its wake. When they landed on [[Threa]], they shattered the lands, creating great fissures filled with what would be known as [[The Pale]]. This first [[Portentous Events|Event]] would come to be known as [[Shardfall]]. The [[Hallowed]] would begin to appear soon after. However this was not [[Issinia Slowly Unweaves in Silence]]‘s destined destruction, and the universe lived on. 

With Diadem gone, the other [[Eldorim]] were unshackled from their control and order, and begun to pursue their own goals for the universe, including influence on [[Threa]]. 

#### The Arrival of the Atra, the Sun, and the Moon
After [[Shardfall]], [[Exalted Volition]] commanded [[Ashilem]] and his children, the [[Atreans]], to go to [[Threa]] and carry out their will.

When they arrived on [[Threa]], they began converting mortals to their worship, offering great boons and magic in exchange for offerings and devotion. This exchange was eagerly accepted by most mortals, with the promise of better lives under more forgiving gods than the [[Thrae]], and safer than the occult gods. 

When the [[Atreans|Atrean]] gods were born of a great flame in the far realms, [[Volar]]. They brought this flame with them when they arrived on [[Threa]], and installed it in the sky as the Sun which bears the same name. This sun obscured the light of [[The Stars]], lessening their influence over the lands. In retaliation, [[The Stars]] sent the moon, a celestial object filled with power, to destroy the sun. Instead, the [[Atreans]] set the sun to flee the moon, and thus the cycle of days and nights begun. It is said if the Moon ever catches the sun it will be annihilated, and the strength of Star-driven fate will return in full force to [[Threa]]. 

##### The War of Thrae and Atreans
The [[Thrae]] were outraged by this invasion of new gods and their influence in allowing mortals to change the lands. Furthermore, their conversion of mortals to their worship decreased souls to offer to [[Threa]]. They went to war against the Atrean gods. 

Mortal folk now had to make a choice of which gods they would follow, [[Thrae]], [[Atreans]], or neither, though most choose one side or the other. It was not uniform amongst any ancestry as well—there were clans, tribes, and kingdoms of nearly every ancestry that aligned with both sides.

With the [[Atreans|Atrean]] arrival began 1st Recorded Era, and the second age, the [[1st Era]].







>[[Issinia Slowly Unweaves in Silence]], despite her nature, is a compassionate and loving being. She resented [[Aedai Speaks the Primordial Word]] for the role she was forced into. Facing him after creation, she used her power to shatter the [[Eldorim]]. [[Aedai Speaks the Primordial Word]] for their part, expected this, and accepted it as fate. From the four pieces of the First formed four more [[Eldorim]], the [[Pillars of Creation]] one each for the pure outer realms. They would hold domains over fate, luck, growth, and rot. [[Issinia Slowly Unweaves in Silence]] continued on her own, waiting at the [[Far Shore]] for her destined time to end the world.


>No one is sure how the world was formed. No one remembers when the first gods for the realms appeared, the [[Thrae]], bubbled up from the fecund ground on [[Threa]], the [[Atreans|Atrean]] gods of the Flame, or the hidden gods of the void and darkness, or when the [[Weaver of Fate]] hung her lanterns in the sky as [[The Stars]], guiding the fate of all below, or where the unknowable outer gods that exist at the fringes of existence, the [[Eldorim]], came from.  

>One thing that is known is that the [[Litany of Creation]] is woven through all things, and the gods and other powers all know snatches of this song, [[Truespeech]] that can shape and change the world. It is says if the full Litany is reassembled, the universe can be un-done and re-shaped in the image of one who recites it.

>The [[Dragons and Dragonkin||Dragons]] claim the world was created by the Godwyrm, and the first of their kind was shed from its scales. They speak much of the [[Truespeech]] of magic and creation, lending credence to their story, but they guard their knowledge and power as close as any gemstone or coin.

>Perhaps it was the [[Eldorim]] themselves, or random chance of the collision of their far realms, but to try and glean knowledge from an outer god is to invite madness, or worse. 

>Perhaps [[Issinia Slowly Unweaves in Silence]] knows, the one destined to end creation. After all, all that lives must die, all that begins must end, but she only waits patiently for her destined due and tells no tales of time before.

>What is known is [[Threa]] is a special place, the material world at the conjunction of many planes, and where it grinds against the [[outer realms]] the [[Border Planes]] are formed. And the various powers of the vast universe vie for control and influence over [[Threa]] and its people.

>The [[Thrae]] gods grow and tend to the primal world, gods in the void whisper and plot in the darkness, and the [[Atreans|Atrean]] Gods of the Flame build their [[Endless Citadel]] in the heavens. All the time, the [[Eldorim]], unable to affect [[Threa]] directly, plot incomprehensible machinations in the far realms.




>### The Fall of [[Exalted Volition]]
The other [[Eldorim]], seeing the power of the Sigils and the influence this granted [[Exalted Volition]] on [[Threa]], attacked [[Exalted Volition]]. The [[Eldorim]] was shattered, its body falling in shards to [[Threa]], shattering the land into isolated islands between [[The Pale]]. Shortly after, the first [[Hallowed]] would appear. In this process, the other [[Eldorim]] learned the secrets of crating Sigils, and some made [[Sigilbearers]] of their own to influence [[Threa]] and the other realms. However their powers are limited, and their Sigils unstable. They typically can only support one Sigilbearer at a time, who are often at odds with the interests of the other gods or beings. Most notable of these was [[Morosh the Blasphemous Excrescence]]—created by [[Change Unending]] to assault the ordered realms and bring chaos before he was flung into the [[Dark Beyond the Stars]]. He still casts seeds of destruction down upon the other realms, which form [[Demons]]. 

> ### [[Truespeech]] and Sigils
With the last echoes of the [[Litany of Creation]], the [[Dragons and Dragonkin]] created a language that allowed them great power: [[Truespeech]] magic, which they used to form regions of stability within the [[Churn]] to roost in. While others used it to travel to [[Threa]] itself. The [[Eldorim]], as being of pure will, needed no formal method to create magic in their respective realms. But one, [[Exalted Volition]], observing the dragon’s [[Truespeech]], learned to craft powerful Sigils, which could be used to form major gods, known as [[Sigilbearers]]. 

> [[Exalted Volition]] created three Sigils, that formed three Sigilbearer gods: [[En’Taia]], who was sent to [[Threa]], [[Ashilem 1]], who lived on [[Endless Citadel]], and [[Issinia Slowly Unweaves in Silence]], who would be the end of all things.

> [[Ashilem 1]] was charged with the creation of beings that would live and serve [[Exalted Volition]]. To this end he created Souls, which would manifest on the outer planes as various creatures. Additionally, in his initial work he formed beings from his own matter and Sigil power, creating his god children. These he deemed to powerful for his purpose, but useful to serve as rulers over the beings he would eventually form. Souls were finicky and hard to create, only possible by gods with a talents for such creation. They manifested in beings in the outer planes such as celestials, [[devils]], and [[demons]].


>In the beginning, before time, the Godwyrm spoke the [[Litany of Creation]], the litany of [[Truespeech]] that created existence. These were [[Outer Realms]] of pure metaphysical reality, among them the [[Churn]] and the [[Dark Beyond the Stars]], the [[Weft]] and [[Warp]], as well as others, and in the center of each formed an old god, an outer god, an [[Eldorim]]. 

>Where scales of the Godwyrm shook free, the Dragons were created, and they learned the [[Truespeech]] of creation. The Godwyrm then disappeared from existence. 

>Then, the realms collided. From the impact formed the material plane, [[Threa]], and at its borders where the realms ground against each other formed the [[Border Planes]]: [[The Dark]], the [[Ethereal plane]], the [[Echo Realm]], the [[Elemental Planes]]. The [[Eldorim]]could not abide to touch realms other than their own, especially not the mixture that was [[Threa]], and retreated deep into their own realms.

>In other places the realms collided formed sparks of power and thought, the gods. Where blood of unknowable creatures crushed in the collision spilled upon [[Threa]]  sprang the first gods of the land, the [[Thrae]], while in the outer planes other gods formed and founded the [[Endless Citadel]].

>The [[Thrae]] bound their power to the land, shaped it, and made it bloom with life. They formed from pure material realm the [[Fey]] and [[Giantkin]]. 

>The first to travel to [[Threa]] after its creation were the [[Dragons and Dragonkin|Dragons]]. Formed from realms of magic and bearing the knowledge of [[Truespeech]], they could reshape the world with a well crafted word.


>>In the beginning there was nothing, until the [[Litany of Creation]] rang out and formed the foundations of the universe: The unchanging stillness of [[The Dark]] and the formless chaos of the [[Churn]], and from the border of both, the material plane, [[Threa]] came to be, along with several [[Border Planes]]. The song seeded both with energies that would form the [[Eldorim]], and [[Eldvessen]], powerful outer gods and beasts, as well as the primordial [[Dragons and Dragonkin]]. 

>>At the nexus of these major planes was built [[Endless Citadel]], forming the home of most [[Eldorim]] as well as the Outsider beings formed from pure soul energy.

>>The bubbling chaos of the [[Churn]] influenced [[Threa]] forming the mountains, rivers, and other natural formations of the land. The [[Eldorim]] known as the [[Weaver of Fate]] wove lines of order in the void of [[The Dark]], hanging [[the stars]] in this great web whose late imposes fate upon all it touches.


> #### Thrae in the Echo Realm, the House Above and Below
In the earliest eons of [[Threa]], there was only night and starlight. The [[Thrae]] and living things upon the world were bound by fate imposed by [[The Stars]]. Most revered this connection from beyond. However, not all the gods of the time felt this way. A contingent of [[Thrae]] gods and [[Fey]] fled to the [[Echo Realm]], the underworld, a dark mirror image of [[Threa]] where [[The Stars]]‘ influence cannot reach. The [[Thrae]] and [[Fey]] who live in [[Threa]] formed the [[House Above]], and those in the [[Echo Realm]] formed the [[House Below]].
