When the [[Atreans|Atrean]] gods arrived on [[Threa]], they built a massive tower that was used to channel divine energy from the [[Endless Citadel]] to the gods to stave off the effects of the materiel realm, as well as serve as a bridge to the [[Endless Citadel]]. 

At the end of the [[1st Era]], a number of factors conspired to bring about the fall of this conduit, which would damage the [[Atreans|Atrean]] godsâ€™ influence on [[Threa]] forever.

Among those involved in this event are:

The [[Cult of Ameti]], a secretive group manipulating things behind the scenes in the [[1st Era]], who sought to elevate [[Ameti]] back to the state of godhood they felt she deserved, and reverse the curse of mortality her closeness with [[Issinia Slowly Unravels in Silence]] wrought. The cults has worked most of the [[1st Era]] to try and disrupt the Divine Tower and siphon its power to [[Ameti]], as well as punish the other [[Atreans|Atrean]] gods for their perceived abandonment of their sister.

The [[Circle of Magi]], a secretive collective of those studying arcane magic, a practice forbidden and considered blasphemous among most culture of [[Threa]] at the time. The Circle appeared in a momentous and powerful moment during the fall of the tower, but contrary to later beliefs, it was in an attempt to save it, or to reduce the calamitous effects. However, due to existing prejudice against arcane magic and their failure to prevent disaster, the fall of the tower became associated to many with the dangers of arcane mages. Most surviving members of the [[Circle of Magi]] were forced into hiding following this event.

The [[Thrae]], seeing opportunity to strike at their rivals, had a contingent aiding this cause.

[[Morosh the Blasphemous Excrescence]], the instigator of this attack, if only subtly at first. This deity sent a corrupted star to crash down toward [[Threa]], appearing for a while as a red comet in the sky before it was called to the ground, crashing into the Divine Tower and annihilating it.

After this catastrophe, the [[Atreans|Atrean]] Gods were cut off from their stabilizing source of power.
