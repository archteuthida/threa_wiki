The fragments of [[Aedai Speaks the Primordial Word]] tore through the world, shattering the [[Endless Citadel]] and spreading throughout the planes. four large pieces of [[Aedai Speaks the Primordial Word]] end up in each of the [[Outer Realms]], forming a powerful outer god of each realm.

After this act, [[Issinia Slowly Unravels in Silence]] left the [[Endless Citadel]] for the [[Far Shore]], never to return.
