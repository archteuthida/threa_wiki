This Era is marked by the destruction wrought by the hubris of mortals. The lands stand in ruin, raked by magical storms and powerful monsters. The last remnants of mortal kind huddle in small clusters of sheltered reality. 

Some last brave and desperate few believe the world can be mended, and send out expeditions into the chaos to that end. Few return. 

Worse, [[Issinia Slowly Unweaves in Silence]] looks at what mortals have wrought, and takes it for a sign that her time of unmaking the universe has come. The edges of reality fray and unravel under her work. If she cannot be convinced to defer her unmaking, reality as all know it will end.
