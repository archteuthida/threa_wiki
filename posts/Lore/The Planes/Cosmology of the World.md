The planes describe all the realms of the universe. There are four fundamental planes first formed by [[Aedai Speaks the Primordial Word]]: [[The Dark]], the [[Churn]], the [[Weft]], and the [[Warp]]. Where they all meet is formed [[Threa]], the material plane.

### The Planes of Matter

[[The Dark]] and the [[Churn]] are planes of matter, the first of stillness and void, the second of chaos and abundance. At their junction are the elemental planes: fire, water, air, and earth, as well as any combined elements in purer forms than found on [[Threa]].

### The Planes of Energy

The [[Weft]] and [[Warp]] are planes of metaphysical power and energy. The former is the plane of life force and positive energy, the latter of death, undeath, and negative energy. Where they meet is the [[Endless Citadel]], a stable outsider land of pure energy and spirit. This is where the gods and outsiders are formed.

### Cross Planar Junctions

The planes of matter and energy each have junctions with each other as well. Where [[The Dark]] meets the [[Weft]] and [[Warp]] forms [[The Stars]], powerful entities that control fate, and hover over [[Threa]].

Where the [[Churn]] meets the [[Weft]] and [[Warp]] forms the [[Echo Realm]], a wild mirror of [[Threa]] that is both abundant with life and shadow.

### [[The Pale]]
Formed after [[Threa]] was shattered, [[The Pale]] separates the broken lands. Deep in [[The Pale]]â€™s depths, it touches the [[Churn]] or [[The Dark]] directly, and the influence of these planes makes [[The Pale]] unpredictable and dangerous in nature.
