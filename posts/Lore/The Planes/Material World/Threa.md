Threa is the world. The lands of the material plane, on which most mortals reside. Threa resides between the chaos of the [[Churn]], and the cold void of [[The Dark]]. Where these opposing planes meet, chaos was tempered into matter, overseen by the dark above. At the fringes of the plane are great swaths of elemental power, but the lands themselves are endless.
