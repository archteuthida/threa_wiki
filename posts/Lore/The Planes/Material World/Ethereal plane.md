This plane overlays [[Threa]], and shares the physical features of the other plane. The [[Ethereal plane]] has passages to several common afterlife planes. 

The first is the [[Near Shore]] of the [[Silent Sea]], both of which also border [[The Underworld]]. This is the one place that differs from the material plane in the [[Ethereal plane]]. The [[Silent Sea]] is a great, still body of water. It is said that crossing it leads to the [[Far Shore]] where a paradise and [[Issinia Slowly Unravels in Silence]] awaits. The paradise is a place of pure beauty and pleasure to souls who can cross, until they tire of existence. At that point hey can succumb to Issiniaâ€™s Embrace, and be destroyed forever. However, to cross the sea requires a soul to swim it, and souls are burdened by wrongdoings committed and attachment to the material world, which manifest as heavy chains. Any soul heavily burdened will sink to the bottom of the [[Silent Sea]] and be trapped forever in the terrifying deep, harried by monsters and soul-eating gods that live in the depths.
