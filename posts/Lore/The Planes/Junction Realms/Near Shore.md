The one place in the border [[Ethereal plane]] that does not correspond to the material world. The Near Shore lies on the [[Silent Sea]], which souls can cross to reach the [[Far Shore]], if they can swim the vast sea or book passage. 

[[Ortoh, Judgement of Souls]] patrols these shores, judging them by their deeds in life and casting them to the [[Devils]] in [[The Underworld]] if found wanting, and warning souls to purify themselves before attempting any crossing of the [[Silent Sea]].
