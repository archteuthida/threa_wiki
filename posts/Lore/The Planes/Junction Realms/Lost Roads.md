Also known as the X these long forgotten paths were forged by the [[Eldorim]] long ago. The first of these paths were made to quickly connect between locations on [[Threa]], when it was whole and much larger. Later, the [[Eldorim]] expanded the roads into the [[Outer Realms]] to achieve their ambitions of conquering the universe. 

The Lost Roads can still be used, but are dangerous for three main reasons:

* They are called Lost as only the [[Eldorim]] held the complete maps to all their paths. Brave or foolhardy adventures have attempted mapping the roads in their current state, and have fragments of safe paths, but a complete map is not known to anyone living.
* When [[Aedai Speaks the Primordial Word]] sent [[Morosh the Blasphemous Excrescence]] to destroy the [[Eldorim]] for their hubris, the beast laid waste to many of the roads, making them broken and treacherous.
* Many strange beings have settled the roads, having found long forgotten passages to enter them. Outsiders in particular have many camps and villages here. Monsters have also found their way into the roads and roam lonely stretches looking for easy victims. So do wander the twisted creatures that many [[Eldorim]] became in contact with [[Morosh the Blasphemous Excrescence]]. 

Still, for the capable and knowledgeable, the roads offer a shortcut across [[Threa]], as well as access to other lands separated by [[The Pale]], and the [[Outer Realms]].
